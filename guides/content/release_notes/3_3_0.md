## Major/New Features

### Rails 5.1 support

`Spree 3.3` is now compatible with `Rails 5.1` compared to `3.2` which used to run on `Rails 5.0`.
Thanks to that you can start using all of the [new great features available in Rails 5](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/5_1_release_notes.html)

### Ruby 2.4 support

Spree now works with Ruby `2.2` (`>= 2.2.7`), `2.3.x` and `2.4.x`.

### Preventing duplicate values for number fields

We've added unique indexes and uniqueness validation on `number` field for those models:

* `CustomerReturn`
* `Order`
* `Payment`
* `Reimbursement`
* `ReturnAuthorization`
* `Shipment`
* `StockTransfer`

This change will fix records with duplicate numbers. Migration scripts we're take care of that.

**WARNING** migration process can take considerable amount of time, depending on volume of your data

### Added missing indexes and unique indexes

Besides number fields we've added multiple regular & unique indexes that were missing. This will keep data consistency of your app in check and also will boost it performance.

### Add `quantity` to inventory units and split on demand

Optimising Shipments and Inventory Units.

* Creates a single `inventory_unit` per `state`, per `line_item`, per `stock_location` with a `quantity` field indicating inventory units in that state.
* Adds a `return_quantity` field in `ReturnAuthorization` indicating the number of units to be returned/exchanged.
* Split inventory unit to extract the portion/quantity that needs to be returned. This might be further split depending upon stock availability at the time of generating return.
* Changes prioritizer and adjuster to maximise the number of `on_hand` items from available stocks in multiple `stock_locations`
* Change `splitters/weight.rb` to use **Worst Fit** algo.

### Better Store Credits management in customer Frontend and Admin Panel

Store credit removal feature on spree front-end for partially paid order (with store credit payments). User can remove its store credit payment if additional payment is required/

Admin user can do the same from Admin Panel.

## Upgrade

### Update your Rails version to 5.1

Please follow the
[official Rails guide](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/upgrading_ruby_on_rails.html#upgrading-from-rails-5-0-to-rails-5-1)
to upgrade your store.

### Update Gemfile

```
gem 'spree', '~> 3.3.0.rc1'
gem 'spree_auth_devise', '~> 3.3.0.rc1'
gem 'spree_gateway', '~> 3.3.0.rc1'
```

### Update your extensions

We're changing how extensions dependencies work. Previously you had to match
extension branch to Spree branch. Starting from Spree 3.2 release `master` branch of all
`spree-contrib` extensions should work with Spree >= `3.1` and < `4.0`. Please change
your extensions in Gemfile eg.:

from:
```
gem 'spree_braintree_vzero', github: 'spree-contrib/spree_braintree_vzero', branch: '3-1-stable'
```

to:
```
gem 'spree_braintree_vzero', github: 'spree-contrib/spree_braintree_vzero'
```

### Run `bundle update`

### Install missing migrations

```
rails spree:install:migrations
rails spree_auth:install:migrations
rails spree_gateway:install:migrations
```

### Run migrations

```
rails db:migrate
```

### Other Gotchas

#### Include `UserMethods` in your `User` class

With this release we're not including this automatically. You need to do it manually if you're not using `spree_auth_devise`.

You need to include `Spree::UserMethods` in your user class, eg.

```
class User
  include UserAddress
  include UserMethods
  include UserPaymentSource
end
```

#### Noteworthy Changes

Also please review each of the noteworthy changes, and ensure your customizations
or extensions are not effected. If you are affected by a change, and have any
of your own tips please submit a PR to help the next person!
